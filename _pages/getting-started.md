Often the hardest part of leveraging explainable artificial intelligence can be finding the right tool for the job. Different tools are better suited for different types of data and different problems, especially when there are humans in the loop. The concept map below is designed to give users a bit of a rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which types of tools to try on your data and models.

Click on any resource tag in the concept map below to see associated capabilities.
