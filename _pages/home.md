The Explainable AI Toolkit (XAITK) contains a variety of tools and resources to help users, developers, and researchers understand complex machine learning models. The toolkit combines a searchable repository of independent contributions and a more integrated, common software framework. The toolkit was developed under the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence).
